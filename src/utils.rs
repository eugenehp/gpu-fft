/// Generates a sine wave signal based on the specified frequency, sample rate, and duration.
///
/// This function creates a vector of samples representing a sine wave. The sine wave is generated
/// using the formula: `sin(2 * Ï€ * frequency * time)`, where `time` is calculated based on the
/// sample rate and the sample index.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `frequency`: The frequency of the sine wave in Hertz (Hz).
/// - `sample_rate`: The number of samples per second (samples/second).
/// - `duration`: The duration of the sine wave in seconds.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A vector of `f32` values representing the samples of the generated sine wave. The length of the
/// output vector will be equal to the number of samples calculated as `sample_rate * duration`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let frequency = 440.0; // A4 note
/// let sample_rate = 44100.0; // CD quality
/// let duration = 1.0; // 1 second
/// let sine_wave = generate_sine_wave(frequency, sample_rate, duration);
/// ```

/// Calculates the frequency values corresponding to the given number of samples and sample rate.
///
/// This function generates a vector of frequency values based on the number of samples and the
/// sample rate. The frequencies are calculated as `k * sample_rate / n`, where `k` is the index
/// of the frequency bin.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `n`: The number of frequency bins (samples).
/// - `sample_rate`: The sample rate in Hertz (Hz).
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A vector of `f32` values representing the frequency values for each bin. The length of the
/// output vector will be equal to `n`.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let n = 1024; // Number of frequency bins
/// let sample_rate = 44100.0; // Sample rate in Hz
/// let frequencies = calculate_frequencies(n, sample_rate);

/// Finds the dominant frequencies in the Power Spectral Density (PSD) based on a threshold.
///
/// This function identifies the dominant frequencies in the provided PSD by checking for peaks
/// in the PSD values that exceed a specified threshold. A peak is defined as a point that is
/// greater than its immediate neighbors.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `psd`: A vector of `f32` values representing the Power Spectral Density of the signal.
/// - `frequencies`: A vector of `f32` values representing the frequency values corresponding to
///   the PSD.
/// - `threshold`: A threshold value for identifying dominant frequencies. Only peaks above this
///   threshold will be considered.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A vector of tuples, where each tuple contains a dominant frequency and its corresponding PSD
/// value. The first element of the tuple is the frequency, and the second element is the PSD value.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// let psd = vec![0.1, 0.5, 0.3, 0.7, 0.2]; // Example PSD values
/// let frequencies = vec![0.0, 100.0, 200.0, 300.0, 400.0]; // Corresponding frequencies
/// let threshold = 0.4; // Threshold for dominance
/// let dominant_freqs = find_dominant_frequencies(psd, frequencies, threshold);
/// ```
